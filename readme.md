Magic Mansion Map
===============


Walkthrough, (Puzzle spoiler, )
----------------
In the entrance, a note tells you that key 2 is in the Pavilion. It will take a long time to get there.

Another note in the kitchen tells us that key 1 is in the Butler's room.

To get there from the starting setup, slide the ball-room south, then enter the banquet hall, then the kitchen, then the entrance, slide that south as well and enter the ball-room, then the kitchen. Slide the kitchen north, then west and enter the entrance. Your game should look something like this:

No slide the entrance east twice, this allows you to enter the gallery, east-wing and the Butler's room in the north east.

Here you find the key to unlock key 1, now we can access the top floor! a letter suggest that we look in the chappel upstairs for a key to the basement.

Going upstairs we see that the chapel requires the key in the pavilion, we also find evidence that the Baroness' key has been stolen, and likely is at the escape route (likely the basement).

To get into the pavilion, we need to move the kitchen down one step, to do that we need to enter the kitchen, while the entrance and ball-room are out of the way.

To do this from the position above, move the gallery west twice, then enter the entrance and go to the banquet hall. Slide that north twice and enter the east-wing. Go upstairs, and back down in the entrance. To do that, you need to move the balcony down one step. After that, your game looks like this downstairs

Now go to the ballroom and move that two steps east, then enter the entrance through the gallery, and move the entrance two steps down. You should now be able to enter the gallery through the ballroom. Slide the gallery north once, enter the kitchen, and slide south once, now your lower floor looks like this:

From here the game is almost done, go to the library and slide it east, in the pavilion you get the key to unlock the chappel and most remaining doors.

From here you can enter the chappel, by essentially backtracing the steps you took to move the entrance back under the balcony. From there you can go up, into the chappel, get the basement key, and go back down and enter the basement. Go down in the basement, here you will find the key to the Baroness' room.

Going back up and entering that room finishes the game.


Devlog
========
Idea: A text-based puzzle/escape room game, about a Borneo Orangutan in a late Baroque/Rococo mansion/palace.

The rooms in the mansion can be re-arranged using the Magic Map.

This must be used to solve various puzzles.


To gate progress/learning: First the player can only translate rooms, then the player becomes able to rotate
Finally the player gains the ability to mirror rooms.

Rooms are only available, as they are added to the map.

Initial goals
-------
Saturday: Make map engine, allowing rooms to be loaded and displayed on the map, shifted, and described in the room view.

Sunday: Working inventory system, and interaction with items and exits

Monday:


Map visuals
--------
The map is a grid of 5 by 5 m blocks, Each Char represents one meter height and 2 m width!

The outer edge of the map looks like this:



    ++........++........++....++
    +                          +
    :                          :
    :                          :
    :                          :
    +                          +
    +                          +
    :                          :
    :                          :
    :                          :
    +                          +
    ++........++........++....++

A legend displayed, looking like this:


    /Legend~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    \< ^ > v : Open 1m doors
    /@       : Closed  doors
    \ -- |   : 2m wall
    /"Chapel": Room name
    \"??????": unknown room
    / X      : You are here

A room on the map could look like this

    +---/\--.+
    |     .:C|
    <Entrance>
    |        |
    +---\/---+

The rooms are declared in blocks, each block-side can have 0,1,2 meter doors, which may be locked from this side.

Rooms can slide leftright or updown, but may not intersect, or be "loose"


Skripler engine
------------
Skripler is a terminal based ascii UI library for C++, developer for use in the GMTK Game Jam 2024.

Skripler is less capable than NCurses, but is hopefully faster to work in (important for a JAM), and is available on Windows.

Skripler renders windows to the terminal, windows can be text tables, textures textures, or canvases. Canvases can contain other windows.

Skripler reads lines terminated by enter, unlike NCurses, Skripler does not support "real-time" key presses.

Skripler has been developer PRIOR to the start of the JAM, this does not go against the rule, as it is no different from using a third party engine.

If I remember, I may link the Skripler github repository here.

WARNING
-------
Skripler development has been RUSHED, test driven practices have NOT been used. Bugs are bound to be as plentiful as some place which has a lot of bugs.
